# Quantum Algorithms in Q\#

This repository contains implementations of various well-known quantum algorithms written in [Q#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/user-guide/), Microsoft's domain-specific language for quantum programming.

## Contents

You'll find examples of classic quantum algorithms, including:

* **Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm**
* **Grover’s search algorithm**
* **Shor’s factoring algorithm**
* **Quantum Phase Estimation**
* **Quantum Fourier Transform**
* ...as well as other experimental and educational examples.

All implementations are written with a focus on clarity and pedagogy, making this repository suitable for both educational purposes and self-study.
